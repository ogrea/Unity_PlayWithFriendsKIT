Simple example for code that can help you to realize game with your friends from FACEBOOK by using PhotonNetwork

What is VironIT Unity kit?
The VironIT Unity kit combines a Facebook SDK for Unity functionality with a Photon Unity Networking.
As this development is portable you don't have to spend hours to change the code. You can just move up the framework. 
It also allows growing the connectors amount without loss. 
Installation
To create a new project you have to download and import to the project our open source starter kit and 2 SDKs: Facebook SDK for Unity and Photon Unity Networking SDK.
The Facebook SDK for Unity
The Facebook SDK for Unity provides the opportunity for Unity developers to integrate their games with Facebook.
The SDK complements Unity’s cross-platform support. It supports WebGL, Unity Web Player, Android, and iOS. The Facebook SDK provides a comprehensive collection of Facebook's social features, giving players the ability to share content with their friends to experience a personal, social gaming experience. 
If you do not already have a Facebook App ID for your app, you should create one.
Please note: Before creating a developer account, login in to your Facebook account. 
Once completed, you'll see your app's Basic Settings page. Here you can find your App ID, required within your Unity game configuration to integrate with Facebook.
In the top navigation bar of Facebook for Developers site select Add a New App or use the button below.
Create a new project in the Unity Editor. Download Facebook SDK for Unity from the Facebook for Developers page or from unity Asset Store. 
Unzip this package after downloading. The code for this sample project will be included.
In the Unity Editor, select from the menu 'Assets', 'Import Package' and then 'Custom Package'.  Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the Facebook for Unity SDK and select FacebookSDK.unitypackage.
Import all the assets in the package. 
Save your project. A post-build script will add a new menu item “Facebook” to the Unity Editor. If you don't see this, check your build for compilation errors and try building again.
Photon Unity Networking 
Photon Unity Networking (PUN) is a Unity package for multiplayer games. It provides authentication options, matchmaking, e.g. join a random room, and reliable in-game communication through our Photon backend.
In PUN, you can create “rooms”, that are essentially partitions on the game server to separate groups of players from each other. 
Many game lobbies allow players to filter the results by various criteria. For example, you can rank rooms by price.
If you already have an AppID or registered email, you can enter them now. But if you haven’t used PUN before, you have to create a new account and set up your first project.
To begin, go ahead and sign up for Photon Cloud at https://cloud.exitgames.com
After you've created an account, go to the Dashboard (My Photon | Applications) and create a new Application. The name is not important, but you'll want to copy the ID for later.
Please note: You have to create Realtime and Chat applications.
Next, visit the Photon Engine official page or Asset Store and search for Photon Unity Networking. The first asset you see should be Photon Unity Networking Free. Download this asset into your project.
Upon downloading the plugin, and importing via Assets | Import Package | Custom Package, you are prompted with a window asking you to sign up, enter an app ID, or set up a custom-hosted server.
Click on the Setup option, assuming you have already created an account with Photon Cloud. Select which region you want to use by default, and paste the ID you copied from the website into the AppId field, and click on Save.
In the Unity Editor, select from the menu 'Assets', 'Import Package' and then 'Custom Package' and select your file.
